NOTE: this  lab follows the  discussion in  Section 5.1 in  the book
"Parallel   Programming  and   Optimization   with   Intel  Xeon   Phi
Coprocessors",  second edition  (2015). The  book can  be obtained  at

This exercise demonstrates how to use MKL in the automatic offload,
compiler assisted offload and native modes.

1. Compile and run the application as a host executable.
   Test its performance and then enable automatic offload by setting
   the environment variable MKL_MIC_ENABLE=1.
   Optimize performance of the application using environment variables
   for thread count and affinity control as described in lab 
   4/4.07-threading-affinity/part-1-compute/

2. Compile the application as a coprocessor executable.
   Test and optimize its performance using environment variables
   as in the previous step.

3. Add the necessary pragmas to the code to explicitly
   offload the call to the function DGEMM to an Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor
