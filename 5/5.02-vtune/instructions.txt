In this exercise, we will look at how to use VTunes. For step-by-step guide 
with pictures refer to the Text.

1. Create a project for host execution. Use the run-on-host.sh script
   instead of the binary executable, app-CPU. Using a bash script makes
   it easier to set environment variables. (However, it is possible to do
   this using app-CPU and setting the appropriate parameters in project
   properties).

   Profile the application using General Exploration. Then explore the 
   result.  

   Optional: Change the OMP_SCHEDULE from static to guided in the
             run-on-cpu.sh script, then profile the application again.
	     We will be discussing scheduling in a later lab.

2. Create a project for native execution. Again use run-on-mic.sh script.
   Note that both the script and the executable must be in the same 
   directory on the coprocessor. 
   
   Use VTune in the native mode to profile the native execution. 

3. Create project for offload. Once again, use the provided script,
   run-offload.sh. Profile the application, then study the result.
