NOTE: this  lab follows the  discussion in  Section 2.1.5 in  the book
"Parallel   Programming  and   Optimization   with   Intel  Xeon   Phi
Coprocessors", second  edition (2015).   The book  can be  obtained at
xeonphi.com/book

In this step  we look at how to asynchronously  offload code execution
to Intel Xeon  Phi coprocessors, and run something on  the host at the
same time. The  code simply multiplies a  matrix A by vector  b on the
coprocessor and on the host, the result in vectors c_target and c_host
compared after the synchronization.

1.  Insert a  pragma to  offload the  calculation of  c_target to  the
   coprocessor

2.  Modify the  pragma to  retain the  memory buffer  and the  data in
   matrix A on the coprocessor

3.  Modify the  pragma so  that the  code asynchronously  offloads the
   calculation of c_target to the  coprocessor and, while this offload
   is running, computes c_host on the host.

4.  Insert a  pragma  to wait  for the  completion  of offload  before
   verifying results.
