NOTE: this  lab follows the  discussion in  Section 2.1.5 in  the book
"Parallel   Programming  and   Optimization   with   Intel  Xeon   Phi
Coprocessors", second  edition (2015).   The book  can be  obtained at
xeonphi.com/book

In this step we look at how to do native execution through MPI. Do not
worry if  you are not  familiar with MPI; we  will cover the  topic in
more depth in later labs. Just note the <mpi.h> header file, and learn
how to run MPI processes.

1.  Compile the  code with  mpiicpc for  the host,  then run  it using
   mpirun on the host.

2. Compile the code with mpiicpc for the MIC architecture, then run it
   using mpirun on the Xeon Phi coprocessor.

3. Run the MPI process on  the host and all the available coprocessors
   using mpirun.
