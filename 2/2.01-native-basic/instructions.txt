NOTE: this lab follows the discussion in Section 2.1.1 to 2.1.3 in the
book  "Parallel  Programming  and  Optimization with  Intel  Xeon  Phi
Coprocessors", second  edition (2015).   The book  can be  obtained at
xeonphi.com/book

In this step we look at how to do native execution through 
ssh and micnativeloadex. The code simply prints out the number
of available logical processors (use `man sysconf` to find more)

1. Compile the code for execution on the host, then run it.

2. Now compile it for native execution on the Xeon Phi coprocessor.
   Copy the binary executable to the coprosessor and run it using ssh.

3. Run the binary executable on the coprocessor using micnativeloadex.

4. Remember that all library dependencies must be accessible
   by the coprocessor. Compile this code with -qopenmp flag to link
   OpenMP library. Try to run new executable natively on Xeon Phi.  Hint:
   Compiled OpenMP library should be copied to mic0:/lib64 with root privileges

5. Delete libiomp5.so from mic0:/lib64. Run the code with micnativeloadex.
   Set up SINK_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MIC_LD_LIBRARY_PATH to resolve 
   OpenMP library dependency for the code compiled with -qopenmp flag.
