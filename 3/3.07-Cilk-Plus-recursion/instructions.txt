NOTE: this  lab follows the  discussion in  Section 3.3.3 in  the book
"Parallel   Programming  and   Optimization   with   Intel  Xeon   Phi
Coprocessors",  second edition  (2015). The  book can  be obtained  at

In this step, you will learn how to implement parallel recursion using
Cilk  Plus. The  provided source  code implements  recursive numerical
integration of the function 1/sqrt(x) with  respect to x from x=0.0 to
x=1.0.  Your  task  is  to  parallelize  recursive_integral().  Before
starting, compile and run this code to check its output.

1. Parallelize recursive_integral() using parallel recursion with Cilk
   Plus. You should only have to add two Cilk Plus keywords.  Run your
   application to check the result.
