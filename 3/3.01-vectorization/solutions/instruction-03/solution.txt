The case of my_scalar_add();

    The compiler does  not know if the  my_scalar_add() is safe
    to  vectorize, because  the contents  of the  function may  not be
    vectorizable.    For   example,    the   function    may   contain
    non-thread-safe functions. Thus  the  compiler  takes  a defensive
    stance and does not implement vectorization.
