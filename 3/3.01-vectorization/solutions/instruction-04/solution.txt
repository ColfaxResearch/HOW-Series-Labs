The case of my_vector_add();

    The compiler does not know if the input array pointers "a" and "b"
    map  overlapping  memory regions.  For example, a  and b  could be
    pointing    to    addresses    that     are    offset    by    one
    (i.e. a[i]=[i]+a[i+1]).  In such cases vectorization  will lead to
    incorrect results.  Thus compiler  makes two  implementations; one
    with vector instructions  and one without.  Then at  run time, the
    application has  a check  to see  if the  memory regions  from the
    input arrays overlap, and choses the implementation accordingly.
