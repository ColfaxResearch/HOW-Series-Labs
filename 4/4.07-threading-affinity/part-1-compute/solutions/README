For best results with DGEMM:

- On the host, try
       OMP_NUM_THREADS=<N>
       KMP_AFFINITY=compact,1,0 (if hyper-threading is enabled)
       KMP_AFFINITY=compact     (if hyper-threading is disabled)
  where <N> is the number of physical cores on the CPU or
  the number of logical cores (physical cores times 2).

- On the coprocessor, try
       KMP_PLACE_THREADS=<N>C,4t
       KMP_AFFINITY=compact
  where <N> is the number of physical cores on the coprocessor.
