NOTE: this  lab follows the  discussion in  Section 4.4.5 in  the book
"Parallel   Programming  and   Optimization   with   Intel  Xeon   Phi
Coprocessors",  second edition  (2015). The  book can  be obtained  at

This exercise demonstrates how to tune thread affinity
for a compute-bound application, using as an example
the MKL implementation of the DGEMM function
(double precision general matrix-matrix multiplication).

Run "make" to compile the code. At the end of the compilation,
"make" prints out instructions for running the application
on the host and on the coprocessor. Copy and paste the
commands listed there and try to find the optimum values of
OMP_NUM_THREADS/KMP_PLACE_THREADS and KMP_AFFINITY
