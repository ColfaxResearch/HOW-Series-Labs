For best results with DFFT:

- On the host, try
       OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
       NUMBER_OF_PROCESSES=<N>
       KMP_AFFINITY=compact,0,$OCCUPIED_THREADS
  where <N> is the number of logical physical cores on the CPU.

- On the coprocessor, you will not be able to run ~60 single-threaded processes 
  due to memory limitation. Try to find the maximum number of processes 
  and compute the corresponding number of threads per process.
