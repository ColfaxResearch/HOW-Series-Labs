NOTE: this  lab follows the  discussion in  Section 4.4.5 in  the book
"Parallel   Programming  and   Optimization   with   Intel  Xeon   Phi
Coprocessors",  second edition  (2015). The  book can  be obtained  at

This exercise demonstrates how to tune thread affinity
for an application with limited thread scalability, using as an example
the MKL implementation of 1D DFFT
(discrete fast Fourier transform).

Run "make" to compile the code. At the end of the compilation,
"make" prints out instructions for running the application
on the host and on the coprocessor. Copy and paste the
commands listed there.

Prior to running the exercise, you must edit the script
run-multiple-processes.sh and change the number of processes,
threads per process and the expression for the affinity of each
process. 

Start with 1 process with as many threads as you have available cores
and KMP_AFFINITY=none. Then try 2 processes with half the number of threads.
After that, try to find an expression for KMP_AFFINITY which binds
the threads of different processes to different cores.
