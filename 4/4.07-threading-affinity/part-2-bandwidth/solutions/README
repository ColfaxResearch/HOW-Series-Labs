For best results with array copy:

- On the host, try
       OMP_NUM_THREADS=<N>
       KMP_AFFINITY=scatter
  That works for the host, but propagates OMP_NUM_THREADS
  to the coprocessor, which is undesirable. To avoid, set 
       MIC_ENV_PREFIX=O
  and set 
       O_KMP_PLACE_THREADS=<N>C,4t
  where <N> is the number of physical cores.
