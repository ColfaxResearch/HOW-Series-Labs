NOTE: this  lab follows the  discussion in  Section 4.4.5 in  the book
"Parallel   Programming  and   Optimization   with   Intel  Xeon   Phi
Coprocessors",  second edition  (2015). The  book can  be obtained  at

This exercise demonstrates how to tune thread affinity
for a bandwidth-bound offload application, using as an example
a micro-benchmark similar to the "copy" test in the 
STREAM benchmark.

Run "make" to compile the code. At the end of the compilation,
"make" prints out instructions for running the application
on the host and on the coprocessor. Copy and paste the
commands listed there and try to find the optimum values of
OMP_NUM_THREADS/KMP_PLACE_THREADS, KMP_AFFINITY and MIC_ENV_PREFIX.
The goal is to maximize bandwidth both in the host part of the application
and in the offloaded part.
